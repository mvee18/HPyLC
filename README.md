# HPLC Parsers

# Introduction
This script takes HPLC data in a directory, grabs all of the data in the Signal 1, and converts it to a concatenated CSV file.

# Usage
To use this, run the following commands:

`python3 -m -i [path/to/input_dir] -o [path/to/output/dir]`

This will make a file called `output.csv` in the output directory.
